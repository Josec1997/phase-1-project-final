# Western Boot Collection
Gallery of all the boots you own/admire

## How the App Works
Add an 'URL' of a pair of boots you like along with a 'title' and add it to the the collection! 

## Description
This is my personal phase 1 project for flatiron final, Texas edition. I love boots and own several pairs, here the user can show off what they got/want.
The backend of the project is mocked up by a json server, the user then is free to add as many boots as they like to this gallery. If the user loses the taste for a certian style of boots they can simply delete it and it will be removed from the mock database. Give it a try!
